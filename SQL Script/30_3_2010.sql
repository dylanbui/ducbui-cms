As the oldest of 11 children, money to realize these fantasies didn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t come easy. Ted made his pocket money by selling vegetables and flowers. After leaving school he took on some factory and garage jobs, and then decided to study electronics, becoming a TV and tape recorder technician.\nNever loosing sight of his dream, Ted studied to become a radio operator (sparky) on ships. Working for months on end brought him the finances to travel. He hitchhiked through Europe, Africa, and India. While in India Ted became interested in gemstones and other artefacts.\nBits and pieces were sent home to be sold in the markets. Hevana Pty Ltd was established in 1971, and first traded as World Arts and Crafts.\nIt was a budding business run from Ted\'s parents\' garage in Ryde (Sydney). In 1973 he moved to business premises and expanding rapidly, he moved again in 1979 to the current offices and warehouse. The business now tended more towards fashion jewellery and accessories and the trading name was changed to Acorn Australia (from little acorns big oak trees grow). The company\'s growth resulted in opening warehouses in Melbourne and Brisbane. However in the 90\'s all operations were centralised in Sydney.\n','About Us','About Us','About Us',1,NULL,1239242651,1258344017,0,1),(10,1,NULL,'/public/content/view-detail/id/51/bui-van-tien-duc','delivery-info','Delivery Info','<p>Delivery Info content</p>',NULL,'Delivery Info content','Delivery Info','Delivery Info','Delivery Info',1,NULL,1258020511,1258020772,0,1),(11,1,NULL,'/public/content/view-detail/id/51/bui-van-tien-duc','returns-policy','Returns Policy','<p>Returns Policy content</p>',NULL,'Returns Policy content','Returns Policy','Returns Policy','Returns Policy',1,NULL,1258020716,1258020799,0,1),(12,1,NULL,'/public/content/view-detail/id/51/bui-van-tien-duc','website-use','Website Use','<p>Website Use content</p>',NULL,'Website Use content','Website Use','Website Use','Website Use',1,NULL,1258020740,1258020814,0,1),(13,1,NULL,'/public/content/view-detail/id/51/bui-van-tien-duc','thank-you','Thank you','<p>Order complete<br />\nThanks for choose our service !!</p>',NULL,'Order complete\nThanks for choose our service !!','Thank you','Thank you','Thank you',1,NULL,1258089673,1258089932,0,1),(14,1,NULL,'/public/content/view-detail/id/51/bui-van-tien-duc','complete','Complete','<p>Your new password has been sent</p>',NULL,'Your new password has been sent','','','',1,NULL,1259037939,1259038032,0,1),(47,1,NULL,'/public/content/view-detail/id/51/bui-van-tien-duc',NULL,'test lan 1','<img align=\"left\" style=\"\" width=\"\" height=\"\" class=\"border_img\" src=\"/media/image/images_2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" />',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0),(48,1,NULL,'/public/content/view-detail/id/51/bui-van-tien-duc',NULL,'test lan 2','<img align=\"left\" style=\"\" width=\"\" height=\"\" class=\"border_img\" src=\"/media/image/images_2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" />',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0);
